            If the sentence provides new information that is not a restatement of the previous sentence, use a comma after “of course” at the beginning of the sentence, or before “of course” at the end of the sentence.

We use commas here, before and after of course, to show that it refers to the whole of the first clause.
            The expression was basically a concise way of conveying that something had followed or would follow the normal course of things; i.e., it was exactly how you'd expect it to be.
